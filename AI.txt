     Jug B with a capcity y liters

   Objective - Measure out d liters of water using the two jugs
    Lets say we have 
      Jug A : 5 liter
      Jub B : 3 liter
     Goal - Measure exactly 4 liter of water

      Step-1  Both jugs are empty

      Step-2  Fill Jug A 5 liter
         - (5,0)
         
      Step-3  Pour out 3 liter of water  from Jug A to B
         - (2,3)
         - jug A has 2 liter capcity left and jug b is full
         
      step- 4  Empty jub B
         - (2, 0)

      step - 5  Pour out all the water from jug A to B
          - (0, 2)

      step - 6 Fill out jug A again 5 liter
           - (5, 2)
      step - 7 Pour out the water from jub A to B till jub b is full
           - jug b is of 3 liter capsity
           - (4, 3)
           
      step -8 Now you have exactly 4 liters in Jug A which is desired solution.

        2. Evaluate Leaf Nodes.
           - At the leaf nodes, assign a score based on the outcome.
        3. Backtrack and Assign Scores
           - Starting from the leaf nodes, backtrack up the tree:
           - For Max’s turn, choose the maximum score from the child nodes
           - For Min’s turn, choose the minimum score from the child nodes

            +1 : if x wins
            -1 : if y wins
             0 : if draw
      3. Backpropagate score -
         - The scores from the leaf nodes are passed back up the tree:
         - Maximizing Player (X) chooses the highest score.
         - Minimizing Player (O) chooses the lowest score.

      2. Alternate turns
         - The games should include two player with alternate turns 
         - where one player tries to win the game and other player tries to prevent other player from winning
      3. Tree Traversal Order -
         - Best move should explore First
         - which enance purning efficency
      4. Maxplayer -

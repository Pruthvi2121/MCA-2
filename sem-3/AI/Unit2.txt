1.	What is frame representation?
2.	Explain components of frame with diagram?
3.	Write advantage and disadvantage of frame representations?
4.	Explain features of frame representations?

1. Frame Representation
    -  A Frame Represntation is the data data-structure used in Artificial Intelligence
       to represent knowlodge
    -  It is similar to record or object in programming

2. Components of Frame
   - A frame conatin several components
        1. Frame Name
        2. Slots 
        3. Slot Value
        4. Facets
  
    1. Frame Name - It represent name of the entity.
                    eg (Book, Person etc)
    2. Slots - It represent the attribute or fields that describe the entity.
               eg (title , author, published_at , etc )
    3. Slot value - the value store in each slots. 
               eg for title slots value be "Fairy tales"
    4. Facets - Describe the value of the slots.
       
    Diagram - 
        +----------------------------+
        |        Frame: Book         |
        +----------------------------+
        | Slot: Title                |  ---> Value: "Fairy Tales"
        | Facets:                    |  
        |    - Type: String          |  
        +----------------------------+
        | Slot: Author               |  ---> Value: "Peter Pan"
        | Facets:                    |  
        |    - Type: String          |  
        +----------------------------+

   Advantages/Feature -  
        1. Easier Programming
           -It is easier to program and manage information.
        2. Flexiblity -
           - It is very flexible and are used in many AI appliction like Natural lanaguage Processing (NLP).
        3. Adding new Attribute -
           - It is easy to add new slots(attribute) in the Frame
        4. Default Value - 
           - We can add default value to slots
        5. Handling Missing Data - 
           - It helps in searching missing values.
        6. Easy to Visualize -
           - The frame structure is easy to understand and Visualize.

    Disadvantage - 
        1. Complex -
           - As number of frame and there relationship increase managing and maintaing frame is complex.

        2. Difficulty with dynamic knowlodge -
           - Frames are not ideal for representing  real-time data.

        3. Scalablity -
           - Frame are less scalable as number of frame grows.
        4. Representing complex event -
           -  It is difficult to represent complex event in frame

10.	Explain forward chaining?
11.	Explain backward chaining?
14.	Different between forward chaining and backward chaining?
15.	 Explain forward and backward chaining algorithms with example.

1. Forward chainging -
   1. Forward chaning start from know facts (given information) and look forwords to find
      out solution and conclusion.
   2. It is also know as data driven technique 
   3. It is bottom-up approaches
   4. It is slow compare to Backward chainging
   5. It goal to get the solution 
   6. It works forward from initial state to final state
   7. It uses Breadth-Firest Search
   8. Used in planning, monitoring 
   
  Algorithm :
     step 1 - Start
     step 2 - Apply rule to generate new facts
     step 3 - Repeat Until reach the goal

     For example - 
        Facts - Its raining
        Rule -  If its, rain, I can carry umbrella.
        Check - is it raining ? Yes.
        Conclusion - I should carry umbrella.

    

2. Backward chainging
   1. Backward chaining start from goal or solution that need to achive and look backwords to find out 
      what facts are needed to achive that solution or goal
   2. It is also know as goal-driven technique.
   3. It is top-down approach.
   4. It is Fast compare to Forward chainging
   5. Its goal to find out facts need to get the solution
   6. It works backward from final state to initial state
   7. It uses Depth First Search
   8. Used in automated inference engine, therom proofs

  Algorithm :
      step 1  - start with goal
      step 2. - find out the fact that support the goal
      step 3. - Repeat until facts are found.

      For example -
        Facts- It's raining.
        Rule - If its, rain, I can carry umbrella.
        Conclusion - I should carry umbrella.

1. Frame Representation
    -  A Frame Represntation is the data data-structure used in Artificial Intelligence
       to represent knowlodge
    -  It is similar to record or object in programming

2. Components of Frame
   - A frame conatin several components
        1. Frame Name
        2. Slots 
        3. Slot Value
        4. Facets
  
    1. Frame Name - It represent name of the entity.
                    eg (Book, Person etc)
    2. Slots - It represent the attribute or fields that describe the entity.
               eg (title , author, published_at , etc )
    3. Slot value - the value store in each slots. 
               eg for title slots value be "Fairy tales"
    4. Facets - Describe the value of the slots.
       
    Diagram - 
        +----------------------------+
        |        Frame: Book         |
        +----------------------------+
        | Slot: Title                |  ---> Value: "Fairy Tales"
        | Facets:                    |  
        |    - Type: String          |  
        +----------------------------+
        | Slot: Author               |  ---> Value: "Peter Pan"
        | Facets:                    |  
        |    - Type: String          |  
        +----------------------------+

   Advantages/Feature -  
        1. Easier Programming
           -It is easier to program and manage information.
        2. Flexiblity -
           - It is very flexible and are used in many AI appliction like Natural lanaguage Processing (NLP).
        3. Adding new Attribute -
           - It is easy to add new slots(attribute) in the Frame
        4. Default Value - 
           - We can add default value to slots
        5. Handling Missing Data - 
           - It helps in searching missing values.
        6. Easy to Visualize -
           - The frame structure is easy to understand and Visualize.

    Disadvantage - 
        1. Complex -
           - As number of frame and there relationship increase managing and maintaing frame is complex.

        2. Difficulty with dynamic knowlodge -
           - Frames are not ideal for representing  real-time data.

        3. Scalablity -
           - Frame are less scalable as number of frame grows.
        4. Representing complex event -
           -  It is difficult to represent complex event in frame

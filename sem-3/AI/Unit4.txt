NLP (Natural Lanaguage Processing)
1. NLP - It is branch of Artifical Intelligence which allows computer to understand and Process
   Human Lanaguage.

Working -
   1. Input - 
     -  Machine recive text or speech as a input.
   2. Tokenization -
     - Split text into smaller unit called tokens.
   3. Analysis -
     - Machine extract key information like name, email, address and resolve ambiguties.
   4. Output -
    - Machine respond or perform a task such as translation, text to speech etc.


Components -

    1. Tokenization -
        - Split the text into smaller unit called token.
    2. Morphological Anaysis - 
        - Indetifify root form of the words.
          eg running as run
    3. Syntax Analysis -
        -  It is also know as parsing.
        -  Here grammer checking take place.
    4. Semantic Analysis -
        - It focus on understandi the meaning of word or sentence.
    5. Named Entity Recognation -
        - Identify the key entities like name, email, address.
    6. Sentiment Analysis -
       - Identify sentiment, emotion, expression in the sentence.
       eg - (positive, negative, neutral).
    7. Lanaguage Generation -
       - Creating meaningful text.
    8. Machine translation -
       - Translate the language into diffrent language.
    

Advantage -
    1. Automates task -
        - It is used to automate task like summarization, tranlation etc.
    2. Customer Service -
        - Enhance Customer service throguh chatbots.
    3. Provide Insights -
        - Provide ingishts for social media and reviews.
    4. Sentiment Analysis -
        - Help in feedback anylisis from customer
    5. Time Efficent -
        - It is very time efficent.
    6. Cost Efficent -
        - It is very cost efficent.
    7. Communication -
        - NLP helps computer to comunicate with humans with there language.
    8. Content Generation -
       - new and orignal content generation can be possible using nlp.

Disadvantages -
    1. Language Ambiguties 
        - One words can have multipal meanings.
    2. Require large data -
        - It require large data for training.
    3. Complexity -
        - Human lanagugae is complex to understand
        - it is hard to indetify sentiments.
    
    4. Required High computational Power
        - It requried high computational Power

Tokenization -
  - Tokenization is about spliting the text into smaller unit called token.
  Types of tokenization -
     1. Word Tokenization 
     2. Sentence Tokenization
     3. Character Tokenization

    1. Word tokenization 
      - Split the text into words
    2. Sentence Tokenization
      - Split the text into sentences
    3. Character Tokenization.
      - Split the text into individual charaters.

    For Example -
      1. Consider sentence 
         "I love programming"
      2. Tokenization -
         ["I", "love", "programming"]

Bag of WOrds (BoW) Example -
   - It is model which represent the text by counting frequency of each words.
     igoring words order and grammer.

     For example 
       1. "I like apples"
       2. "I like mango"

    step - 1 tokenization
        1. ["I", "like", "apples"]
        2. ["I", "like", "mango"]
        
    step - 2 Create vocabulary.
        1. Vocabulary : ["I", "like", "apples", "mango"]
    
    step - 3  Count frequenies
        Sentence 1: ["I" = 1, "like" = 1, "apples" = 1, "oranges" = 0]
        Sentence 2: ["I" = 1, "like" = 1, "apples" = 0, "oranges" = 1]

    step - 4 BoW Respresentation

       Sentence 1 - [1, 1, 1, 0]
       Sentence 2 - [1, 1, 0, 1]

Stemming - 
    Defination - Reduce the words to there root form by chopping prefix or suffix 
    Example -
       running --> run
    Advantage -
      1. Fast -
         - It is faster than lemmatization
      2. Best for Data Retrival -
         - Userful for data retrival task like serach engine , keyword matching.
      3. Simplicity -
         - It is easy to implements.
     
    Disadvantages -
      1. Non-Standard words -
         - Sometimes it give non-standards words 
         - eg Happily --> Happi indtead of happy.

      2. Over-stemming -
        - Sometime it remove incorrect part of the words
        - eg better --> bet
       

Lemmatization -
   Definition - Reduce the words to there base form by considering words meaning 
                and context.
    Advantage -
        1. Accurate Result -
          - Provide valid and meaningful words, which make it more accurate than stemming.
        2. Context-aware -
          - It is consider words part of speech and meaning.
        3. Always Accurate words -
           - Provide Always accurate words from dictionary.

    Disadvantages 
      1. Slow -
         - It is very slow, it takes lot of time to process.
      2. Required High computational Power 
         - It require large computational power compare to stemming.
      3. Complex -
         - It is complex to implements.

3.	Explain Stop words and there advantages and disadvantages?
    Advantage -
       1. Reduce Noise -
         - Removing stop words reduces unnecessary words in the dataset,
       2. Save Computational Resources 
         - It save computational resourses.
       3. boost perfromance 
         - It increases the performance of the model.
    
    Disadvantage -
        1. Loss of context 
            - sometime it remove the importance context .
        2. Lanaguage Specific -
            - Stop-wards are lanaugage dependant
        3. False Relevane -
            - Remove meaningful function words.

Genetic Algorithm
  - Defination -
    - A genetic algorithm is a techniques for optimization and search engine inspired by the process of
      natural selection.
    - It uses the principl of evolution, selection, crossover, and mutation to find solution to the problem.

    Componets -
      1. Population - 
         - It is set of candidate solutions. eg (chromosomes x, y)
      2. Selection -
         - choose the best solution based on fitness.
      3. Crossover -
         - combining parts of two soltuion to create new solution.
      4. Mutation -
         - Randomly change to the solution to introduce variety and better solution.
      5. Fitness funtion -
         - Fitness funtion measure of how good a solution is.

    Working -
      1. Generate Initial population
         - Create set of random solutions.
      2. Evaluates Fitness 
         - 
      3. Selection -
         - choose the best solution based on fitness.
         - highter fitness is the parent for next generation
      4. Crossover -
         - combining parts of two soltuion to create new solution.

      5. Mutation -
         - Randomly change to the solution to introduce variety and better solution.
      
      6. Repeat the process 
         - Repeat the process until satified and optimal solution found.

1. NLP - It is branch of Artifical Intelligence which allows computer to understand and Process
   Human Lanaguage.

2. Genetic Algorithm
  - Defination -
    - A genetic algorithm is a techniques for optimization and search engine inspired by the process of
      natural selection.

1. Informed search (Heuristic Search)
  Defination - Infomed search algorithm explore the search space with having extra information
              called (Heuristics) to reach the goal. they protise the option based on there extra knowlodge.
              
2. Uninfomed search (Blind Search)          
Defination - Uninfomed search algorithm explore the search space without having any extra information
                  about how to reach the goal. they treat all options equally and do not use any clues and strategies
                  to reach goal.
                  
 Neural Network -
         -  Neural network is the model inspired by human brain, consist of inter-connected 
            neuron, used to learn pattern and make prediction from data.

- . Activation function -
      Activation funtion in neural network is mathematical funtion applied to neuron to 
      indentify its activation level.

   2. RNN is neural network designed for sequential data.

  - DNN 
   1. It is type of artificial neural network which consist of multipal hidden layers 
       between the input and output layer

5) Differentiate between informed and uninformed search algorithms in AI. 

    6. Explain Informed search algorithm ?
    7. What is informed search, and how does it differ from uninformed search?
    8. Explain Heuristic Search in detail.
    9.  Describe Heuristic search with suitable example. .

1. Informed search (Heuristic Search)
Defination - Infomed search algorithm explore the search space with having extra information
             called (Heuristics) to reach the goal. they protise the option based on there extra knowlodge.
             
  - 1. It is also know as Heuristic Search
  - 2. It use knowlodge for searching process
  - 3. It find solution more quicky
  - 4. It may or may not be complte
  - 5. It is cost efficient
  - 6. It takes less time because of quick searching
  - 7. It is less complex for implementation
  - 8. It required less computational requirement



2. Uninformed Search (Blind Search)

 Defination - Uninfomed search algorithm explore the search space without having any extra information
              about how to reach the goal. they treat all options equally and do not use any clues and strategies
              to reach goal.
              
  - 1. It is also know as Blind Search
  - 2. It not use knowlodge for searching process
  - 3. It find solution slowly
  - 4. It is always complete.
  - 5. It is costly
  - 6. It takes moderate time because of slow searching
  - 7. It is more complex for implementation
  - 8. It required high computational requirement than informed search

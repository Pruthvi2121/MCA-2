2. What is data science ? Explain the role of Data Scienctist. 

  - Data Science 
      - Data Science is the study of data to find pattern, make prediction, and help in taking better
        desicions, It uses lools like Statistic, Algorithm, programming to convert data into usesful
        insights.

   - Role of Data  Scienctist.
        1. Data Collection
        2. Data Cleaning 
        3. Analyzes Data 
        4. Build Models 
        5. Data Visulization 
        6. Solve Business problem 

        1. Data Collection
           - Gather data from various sources include (database, API's, etc)
        2. Data Cleaning 
           - Clean data by fixing errors, finding missing values, organize it for analysis
        3. Analyzes Data -
           - Analyzes the data to find patterns and trends using statistics .
        4. Build Models -
           - Create Predictive models using machine learning.
        5. Data Visulization -
           - Visulize finding using ploting graphs, charts, etc 
             to help non-technical teams understand the results.
        6. Solve Business problem 
           - Collaborate with Business teams and provide insights and recommandation based on Research
             to make better desicions.

3. Describe any four  tools of data science.
    1. Python
    2. Pandas 
    3. Numpy
    4. Matplotlib
    5. Tableau
    6. SQL
 
 
    1. Python-
       - Popular programming lanaguage used for data-analysis and machine-learning
    2. Pandas -
       - Python libries to manage and anaylise data in tables (Dataframe)
    3. Numpy -
       - Python librires to perform numerical operation over datasets.
    4. Matplotlib -
       - Python libries for data Visulization using diffrent charts, dashborads, graphs, etc
    5. Tableau 
       - tool used to organize data 
    6. SQL -
        language for querying and managing data in relational databases

4.   What is hadoop ? Explain Hadoop ecosystem with diagram.
    - Hadoop 
      1. Hadoop is an open-souce framework 
      2. It is used to store and process larage amount of data across diffent
         distributed computer environment.
    
    - components of Hadoop
                1. HDFS
                2. MapReduce
                3. YARN
                4. Hive
                5. Pig
                6. Mahout
                7. Zookeeper
                8. Oozie
         
        1. HDFS 
            -  HDFS stand for Hadoop Distributed File System.
            -  It is used for storing data accross multipal computer sytems.
        2. MapReduce
            - MapReduce is used for processing data parallel accross multipal computer Systems
        3. YARN 
            - YARN stands for Yet Another Resources Negotiator
            - It is a Resources management layer of hadoop for managing and scheduling jobs.
        4. Hive
           - It is SQL for Hadoop 
           - Allow you to querry data using sql-like lanaguage
             make it easier to interact with hadoop
        5. Pig -
            Tool that help you to write data processing script with knowing complex programming.

        6. Mahout 
           - Mahout provide machine learning algorithim to process data in hadoop.

        7.  Zookeeper 
           - Helps in cordination among diffrent distributed computer system
           - provide task synchronization over system.

        8.  Oozie -
           - It perform task of scheduling jobs

30.  What are the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning?
     Supervised                            Unsupervised
   1. Uses known data as inputs            1. Uses Unknown data as inputs.
   2. Less Computational complex           2. Highly Computaional complex.
   3. Uses Off-line anaylises              3. Uses Real-time Anaylises.
   4. Number of classes is known           4. Number of classes not known
   5. Give Accurate results                5. Give moderate accurate results.
   6. Disired output is given              6. Disired out is not given.
   7. Uses labeled training data           7. Uses No labeled training data.
   8. Model can be tested                  8. Model cannot be tested.
   9. Example -                            9. Example -
      Optical character recognation (OCR)     Face detection 

   Working -                               Working -
   Input                                   Input
     - input labled data                      - input unlabled data
   training                                training
     - try to find hidden pattern            - try to find hidden pattern, clusters,similiaries

Architecture -
    - Hadoop architecutre has three layers
      1. Storage Layer
      2. Proccesiing Layer
      3. Resource Management Layer

    1. Storage Layer
       - It is handle by HDFS
       - In this layer HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) split the data into blocks 
         and distribute accross diffrent computer system (nodes)

    2. Processing Layer
       - It is mostly handle by MapReduce 
       - In this layer parallel data processing accross diffrent distributed computer system (nodes) take place.

    3. Resource Management Layer
       - Handle by YARN
       - In this layer task managaing and scheduling job take places

Ques 1. What is php and explain varables in php ?

1. PHP is stands for hypertext preprocessor
2. It is server-side  scripting language mainly used for web-development
2. It can be embedded in HTML to create dynamic web pages
3. the .php is the file extention for the php file
3. Varables are the container for storing data values in PHP.
4. A varables start with $ sign followed by the name of the varables.
5. Syntax -
     $varable_name = value;
6. Rules for naming varalbe
    1. Every variable name must begin with $.
    2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
    3. A varable should not contain space
    4. Variable names are case sensitive, meaning $var and $Var are different.
    5. Use descriptive varable name
    6. Use letters, numbers, and underscores after $ sign

7. PHP support several data types for varables including int, string, float , double.
8. You can change the varable name at any time for example
    $age = 4;
    $age = 8;
                      +-------------------+
                      |     Variable      |  
                      |   $variableName   |
                      +-------------------+
                                |
                                v
                      +-------------------+
                      |       Value       |
                      | "Hello, World!"   |
                      |        25         |
                      |      19.99        |
                      |      true         |
                      +-------------------+

2. Explain different data types in php ?
   There are different data types in php.
     1. String
     2. Integer
     3. Float
     4. Boolean
     5. Object
     6. NULL
     7. Array
     8. Resource

  1. String - It is sequence of characters inside the quotes.
      eg - $name = 'John';
 
  2. Integer - Used to store integer value (whole number)
      eg - $age = 60;

  3. Float (or Double)  = A number that includes a decimal point.
      eg - $price = 4.4;
  4. Boolean - A data type that can hold only two values: true or false.
      eg - isActive = true;
      
  5. Array -  A collection of values stored in a single variable.
      eg - $colors = array("red", "green", "blue");
           $numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
           
  6. Object - An instance of class that contain data and funtion.
      eg - 
          class Car {
              function Car() {
                  $this->model = "Toyota";
              }
          }
          $myCar = new Car();

  7.NULL - Represent value with no value
      eg - $var = NULL;

  8. Resources - Holds a reference to external resources (like database connections)
      eg - $file = fopen("test.txt", "r");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Explain operator with sutable example
   1. operators are special symbols that perform action on varables and values
   2. Following are the diffrent operators in PHP
      1. Arithmetic Operators
      2. Assignment Operators
      3. Logical Operators
      4. Comparison Operator
      5. Increament Operator
      6. Decrement Operator
      7. Ternary Operator
      8. String Operator 
      9. Null Coalescing Operator (??)

1. Arithmetic Operators
   - Arithmetic operators perform arithmatic operations on operends
     such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division, modulus etc.
     1. +, -,*, %
     eg - $sum = 4 + 2
          $sub = 4 - 2

2. Assignment Operators 
   - Assignment Operators assign values to varables.
   eg - simple assignment (=)  $x = 10;
        add and assign (+=)   $x += 1; or $x = $x + 1
        subtract and assign (-=)  $x -= 1; or $x = $x - 1

3. Comparison Operators
   - Compare two values and return True or False
     1. Equal ==        eg 4 == 4;  //true
     2. Not Equeal !=    eg 4 != 2   // true
     3. Greater Than (>) eg 4 > 2   // true
     4. Less Than (<)    eg 4 < 2   // false
     5. Identical (===)  eg 4==='4'  // false (compare both values and there types)

4. Logical Operators 
    - Logical operators compare multipal conditions
    followoing are the logical operators
     AND (&&) -  when both the values are true then only true
     OR (|)  - when any of the value is true then true
     NOT (!)  invert the value (true --> false, false--> true)

5. Increament/Decrement Operators -
   - Increase or decrease a value by 1.
   Examples:
       Increment (++):  $x = 5; $x++; // $x becomes 6 
       Decrement (--):  $y = 5; $y--; // $y becomes 4
       
 6. String Operator(.)    
   - Combine and manupulate string
   Example -
      $str = "Hello" . "World"
      $str .= "Welocome"

7. Ternary Operator 
   shorthand symbols for if..else statement
   eg -
      $can_drive = ($age>=18) ? "Yes" : "No";

8. Null coalscing Operator (??)
  - Return the first value if exist , otherwise the second
  for example 
      $name = $_GET['name'] ?? 'Guest';
      // If 'name' is not set, 'Guest' will be assigned
          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Explain different conditional statement in php ?
  following are the diffrent conditional statement in php
      1. if statement
      2. if else statement
      3. elseif statement
      4. switch statement
      
1. if statement 
   - It executes a block of code if the condition is true.
    eg -
       $age = 18;

       if ($age >= 18) {
           echo "You are an drive.";
       }
2. if else statement
   this statement provide alternative block of code when condition is false
   eg -
        $age = 16;

        if ($age >= 18) {
            echo "You are an drive.";
        } else {
            echo "You cannot an drive.";
        }

3. else-if statement
   - Allows you to test multiple conditions, executing different blocks of code depending on which condition is true.
   eg -
         $marks = 75;
         if ($marks >= 90) {
             echo "Grade: A";
         } elseif ($marks >= 75) {
             echo "Grade: B";
         } else {
             echo "Grade: C";
         }
4. switch statement -
    It comapare the values with diffrent case
    eg -
      $day = 3;

      switch ($day) {
          case 1:
              echo "Monday";
              break;
          case 2:
              echo "Tuesday";
              break;
          case 3:
              echo "Wednesday";
              break;
          default:
              echo "Not a valid day";
      }

5. Explain different types of loops in php ?
   following are the diffrent type of loop in php.
        1. forloop
        2. while loop
        3. do..while loop
        4. foreach loop

   1. forloop -
      It is used when you know the iteration count
      for loop continue to execute till given condition is true
      for example - displaing number from 0 to 10

          for($i=0, $i<=10, $i++){
              echo $i;
          }

    2. while loop - 
        While loop continue to execute till the condition is true
        It is used when you dont know the iteration count
        for example 
        
            $count = 0;
            while ($count < 4) {
                echo "Count: $count\n";
                $count++;
            }

    3. do..while loop -
        Do while loop is similar to while loop, but execute the body first and then check for the condition
        this loop execute atleast once in his life cycle

        for example 
           $count = 0

           do{
              echo $count
              $count++;
              
           }while($count<4)
<!--  -->
    4. foreach loop -
       foreach loop is specially designed for iterating over arrays.
       for example -
          
        $fruits = ["apple", "mango", "banana", "orange"]

         foreach ($fruits as $fruit){
            echo $fruit
         }
####################################################################################################


6. What is funtion? Explain recursive funtion in php ?
  1. Function is reusable block of code designed to perform certain task
  2. function may have parameteres
  3. function may return some values
  4. funtion which has paramter are called parametriesed funtion
  5. funciton which does not have any paramter are called non parametaresed funtion.
  6. for example -
      # paramaterised funtion
      function add($a, $b){
          return $a + $b;
      }
      #non paramaterised funtion
      function greet(){
            return "Hello World";
        }

   Recursive funtion -
     The function which call itself to solve the problem are called recursive funtion
     For Example -
      One common example of a recursive function is calculating the factorial of a number.

      the formula for factorial is 
      n! = n * (n - 1)

      function factorial($n){
         if ($n == 0  || $n ==1 ){
            return 1;
         }

         return $n * (factorial($n-1)):
      }

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
7. What is array ? Explain different types of array in php?
   1. An Array in PHP is a special varable that hold multipal values  at once.
   2. Intead of declaring seperate varable for each value you can store that in one array.
   3. It make data management easier.
   4. Type of  Arrays in PHP.
       1. Indexed Array
       2. Associative Array
       3. Muliti-dimentional Array
   5. Index Array -
      This are the simple array, each element in array has assigned index to it
      the index start from 0
      for example -
         $fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
         echo $fruits[1];  // Outputs: Banana

    6. Associative Array
      This array has key value pair,
      This array use named key to that you assigned to each elment 
      Make it easy to identify
      for example -
      $person = ["name" => "John", "age" => 30, "city" => "New York"];
      echo $person['name']  //John

    7. Multi-dimentional Array
       This arrays contain nexted arrays or associative arrays
       for example -
            $students = [
                ["John", 20, "A"],
                ["Jane", 22, "B"],
                ["Doe", 19, "C"]
            ];
  
            echo $student[0][0]  // 'John'
    8. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Explain class and object in php
    class -
        1. class is a group of object which has comman properties
        2. It is templete or blueprint for object which is created
        3. class contain 
            field
            methods
            constructor
            

    Object
    1. An object is an physically and logical entity
    2. while class is an logical entity only
    3. An object is a real-world entity.
    4. An object is a runtime entity.
    5. The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
    6. The object is an instance of a class. 


    For example -
      class Person {
            public $name; // Add a semicolon here
        
            public function __construct($name) { // Correct the constructor name
                $this->name = $name; // Add a semicolon here
            }
        
            public function greet() {
                return "Hello, $this->name"; // Add a semicolon here
            }
        }
        
        $obj = new Person("Rohit"); // Add a semicolon here
        echo $obj->greet();

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. What is inheritance Explain with example

    1. Inheritance is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are
    Abstaraction , Polymorphism and Encapsulation.
    2. Inheritance is the process in which properties of parent class shered to child class
    3. When you inherit one class to another class you can use all the fields and methods in that class
    4. extends keyword is used to inherit the class
    5. the class after extend keyword is the parent class
    6. the class extending the parent class is the child class
    7. why use inheritance
    . for code reuseablity
    . for method overiding (so runtime polymorphisium can be achived)
    8. IN php there are
         single inheritance
         muliti-level inheritance
         hierarchical inheritance

    For example -
         class Animal {
             public $legs = 4;

             public function eat() {
                 echo "Eating\n";
             }
         }

         class Tiger extends Animal {
             public function type() {
                 echo "I am a wild animal\n";
             }
         }

         $tiger = new Tiger();
         $tiger->eat();           // Outputs: Eating
         $tiger->type();          // Outputs: I am a wild animal
         echo $tiger->legs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. what is constructor and destructor in php explain with example
 1. Constructor -
    1. PHP constructor is  a block of code similar to method
    2. It is called when instance or object of class is created
    3. At the time of calling constructor memory is allocated to the object which is created
    4. Every class has its constructor weather we declare or not
    5. . Constructor does not have return type
    6. If we created multiple objects for same class then each time the constructor is invoked
    7. The constructor method is defined using the special name __construct().
    8. There are two type of constructor in php 
       1. default consturctor 
               class Car {
                   public function __construct() {
                       echo "Car is created\n";
                   }
               }
    
               // Creating an object
               $myCar = new Car(); 
               
       2. parameterized constructor
          class Bike {
              public $tyre;
              public $speed;

              public function __construct($t, $s) {
                  $this->tyre = $t;
                  $this->speed = $s;
              }
          }

          // Creating an object with parameters
          $myBike = new Bike("MRF", 180);
          echo $myBike->tyre;  // Outputs: MRF
          echo "\n";
          echo $myBike->speed; 
       
    9. default constructor are the constructor which dones not takes any value
    10. parameterized constructor are the constructor that take paramters as a arguments.

    Destructor -
    1.  It is called when instance or object of class is destroyed
    2.  The destructor is used to perform cleanup tasks, such as 
         closing database connections or freeing resources.
    3. The destructor method is defined using the special name __destruct().
    4. Every class has its destructor weather we declare or not
    5. the destructor is called automatically when the object is no longer needed.

    6. For example 
         class Car{
             public function __construct(){
                echo "I am invoked";
             }

             public function __destruct(){
                echo "I am destroyed";
             }
         }

         $car = new Car();
#########################################################################################################
         Constructor                               Distructor 

1. It called when object is created              1. It is called when object id destroyed
2. It initilized the object                      2. It perfrom cleanup
3. Its syntax is _construct()                    3. Its syntax is _destruct()
4. It call automatically when                    4. Called automatically when object
   object is initialized                            object no longer to use
5. Can accept paramters                          5. Does not accept parameters
6. Commonly used                                 6. Less frequently used
7. Executed at the start of lifecycle            7. Executed at the end of lifecyle
8. Can be called explicity using new             8. cannot be called explicity

2. Enlist the advantages and Feature of MVC?

    1. Sepeartion of UI, data and logic
    2. Reusablity
    3. Testablity
    4. Support Parallel Development
    5. Fast Development

    1. Seperation of UI and logic
       - Keeps things organised
         - Model : handle data
         - View : handle user interface
         - Controller:  handle User Action

    2. Reusablity 
       - You can reuse model, view and controller in diffrent part of application
    3. Testablity 
       - Easier to test each part seperatly.
    4. Support Parallel Development 
       - Different people can work on Model, View, and Controller at same time.
    5. Fast Development
       - Due to better structure and team work development is faster

23. Differentiate between NoSQL and RDBMS
             RDBMS                     NoSQL


            SQL                         NSQL
  1. Structure table with        1. Unstructured, semi-stuctured
     predefined shemas              sturctured.
  2. Fixed schema                2. Varable schema can be changed 
                                    or adopt according to need.
  3. uses Sql for quering and    3. Use's various querry languages
     manupulating data
  4. Desgin for vertical         4. Design for horizontal scalablity.
     scalablity
  5. Invole Atomacity,           5. Basically available in softstate
     Consistency,                   consistent
     Isolation, 
     Durablity 
  6. Less Flexible               6. Highly Flexible
  7. Cost unefficent             7. Cost Efficent
  8. Run on server               8. Run on clouds
  9. less performace             9. High performace
  10. no object orented          10. object orented database
      database
  11. less optimize storage      11. Optimize storage
  12. Data is stored in          12. Data is stored in 
      form of queryset               form of object
  13. For example -              13. Mangodb, Redis,
      Mysql, Postgress,             
      Oracle, SQL server

 17. What is Entity Framework?
 18. Advantages of Entity Framework


 1. Entity Framework is also known as EF 
 2. It is free and opensource
 3. It is Object Relation Mapping (ORM) developed by Microsofit for .Net application
 4. It allow developer to interact or communicate with the database using .Net object
 5. Rather than writing raw sql queries we can use Entity Framwebork to create, update, Retrive , and delete operation
 6. It make it easier to work with diffrent type of database, like sqlite, postgress, mysql etc
 7. It improve maintaince and readablity.
 8. Easier to read and write
 9. Database communication easier using EF ORM.
 10. Automatically tracks changes to objects and update accordingly in database.

 Advantages -
   1. Less code
      - Instead of raw sql, we can use C# 
   2. Faster Development
      - faster development by feature like code-first and Migrations
   3. LINQ Support
      - Querries the database using LINQ (C# style queries)
   4. Automatic Change Tracking
      - Automatically Track changes and update accordingly in database.
   5. Cross Database Support
      - Works with different databases like SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
   6. Strong Typeing
      - Catches error at compile time, not runtime
   7. Easy to Maintain
      - Easy to maintain as code is clean and readable.
   8. Cache Support -
      - Store data in memory to avoid repeative hits
   9. Lazy loading -
     - Load the data only when needs.
  10. Migration Support 
     - Update the database without loosing data.
    
Disadvantages
    1. Performance Issues
       - Slower than raw sql, for complex queries
    2. Less Control 
       - It has less control over optmization of complex queries
    3. Leaning Curve -
       - It can be confusing for beginners
    4. Debugging Issue -
       - Hard to debug exceptions
    5. Not Idel for all projects
       - For small and high performance app, raw sql is better than EV ORM.

 21. Explain different parts of the entity data model.
    The Entity Data Model (EDM) is divided into three parts
    1. Conceptual Model (C# class)
    2. Storage Model (Database)
    3. Mapping ORM

    1. Conceptual Model 
      - It is c# class where we define fields of database
       Example 

       public class Student
       {
            public int id {get; set;}
            public string name {get; set;}
       }
     2. Storage Model
       - It describe the actual database
       - This is how the data is stored phycicall in actual sql server
       Example -
       CREATE TABLE STUDENT( ID INT PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR(100));

    3. Mapping 
      - It is ORM Object Relation Mapping
      - It is used to communicate the database via C# objects
      - It is kind of another language to communcicate with database over sql.
      Example -

      user = context.Users.Find(1);  // find the user with id = 1

Q1. What is Machine Learning? Define & itâ€™s Types.
    1. Machine Learning is subset of Artifical Intelligence
    2. Machine learning is a way for computer to learn from data and imporve over time.
    3. It help computer to make descions or prediction based on patterns in data.

    type of Machine Learning
        1. Supervised learning
        2. Unsupervised Learning
        3. Reinforcement Learning.

        1. Supervised Learning 
            - Here Algorithm trained from Labeled Data.
            - System learned the relationship between input and output to make prediction.

        2. Unsupervised Learning
            - Here Algorithm trained from unlabed data.
            - It find the pattern in unlabed data
         
        3. Reinforcement Learning
           - Learn from Trail and error
           - The system learns from its mistake and eventually train and become better over time.
           - It treis to maximize the rewards
           - Application
             1. Robotic - Used to train robots 
             2. Gaming - Used in advance gameing 
             3. Autonoumous Vechical - Used in Self driving car, traffic navigation 
             4. Recommendation System - Used in Suggestion sytem based on user behavior

Q2. What is the meaning of human learning and its type.
    - Human learning is how we acquire knowlodge, skill, 
      or behavior through experience or study.
    
    Type of Human Leaning.
        1. Classical Conditioning
            - Learn by connecting things.
            Example -Imagine A dog hears a bell every time when food is given.
                      Bell = Food (connection made)
                      Eventually the dog understand that bell mean food.

        2. Operant Conditioning
            - Lean by Rewards or Punishment
            Example - Suppose if child do his homework he will get Rewards
                      if child not do the homework he will Punishment
                      So child understand that he has to do homework for rewards which he wants.

        3. Observational learning
            - Learn by observing other
            Example - child learn to talk by observing other
        
        4. Cognitive Learning 
            - Learn by thinging and understanding
            Example - Solving puzzle by undestanding how the pices fit

Q4. Difference between supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

     Supervised Learning                            Unsupervised Learning

1. Work with Labeled data                      1. Work with Unlabeled data.
2. It predit the output                        2. It not predict the output
3. It has predifined goal                      3. It does not have predefined goal
4. It does not cluster data.                   4. data is cluster
5. It uses target label                        5. It does not use target label.
6. Require supervision                         6. Not require supervision
7. Provide accurate prediction                 7. May or may not be accurate
8. Overfit when too much data                  8. Not Overfit when too much data

Q6. Which is the challenges face in machine larning?
    1. Insufficient or Poor Data
       - ML models need good, complete, accurate data
       - poor data can led poor performance.
    
    2. Overfitting
       - Model is too complex and learn unnessary detail.

    3. Underfitting 
       - Model is too simple and miss complex pattern

    4. High Computational Cost 
       - Training Large model required lot of Computational Power.
    
    5. Data Security And Privacy
       - Protecting Sensitive data while training is challanging.
    
    6. Scalablity
       - Less scalable as data grow
    7. Alogorithm selection -
       - Algorithm selection is challanging.
    8. Transering Model -
       - Model swithing or transfering is challanging

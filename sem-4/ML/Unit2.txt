Q3. Explain Data Quality Assessment and explain missing values and outliers 
   Data Quality Assessment
      1. Data Quality Assessment is the process of checking if data is correct, complete, and useful.
      2. The Key checks include
            1. Is the data accureate ?
            2. Is anything missing ?
            3. Are there any duplicates or error ?

   Missing Values -
       1. These are empty or blank entries in data.
       2. Reason of occurance
          1. Skiped questions in survey
          2. Error while collecting data or entering data.
       3. Handle Missing Values
          1. Remove them if they are flew
          2. Fill out with average, most common value

   Outliers 
     1.  Outliers are values that are very different from others.
     2. Reason of occurance
        1. Mistake in data entry 
        2. Rare events
     3. Handle Outlier
        1. Check and correct if its is mistake.
        2. Fix or remove if needed
        3. Use tool like box plot to spot them.

Q4. What is meant by Duplicate values and give example of duplicate values
    Duplicate values 
      1. Duplicate values are the rows in the dataset which are the exact copy of another rows
         or the values are repeated with same informations

      2. Response of occurance
         - Data being enter twice
         - System Error while collecting or migrating data.
      3. Duplicate data can cause error in analysis.

      4. Table -
            +----+---------+-----+
            | ID | Name    | Age |
            +----+---------+-----+
            | 1  | Alice   | 25  |
            | 2  | Bob     | 30  |
            | 3  | Alice   | 25  |
            | 4  | Charlie | 22  |
            +----+---------+-----+
      5. In this table, rows 1 and 3 have the same Name and Age, so they are duplicate values.

 Q5. Write short note on Feature Aggregation with example
     Feature Aggregation
       1. Feature Aggregation is the process of combining two or more features (columns) into a single new feature
          to simplify data and to create more meaningful information
       2. It help in reducing complexity
       3. It improve model performance.
       4. Make it easier to see patterns

      Example -
         
         +------------+------------+
         | Math       | Science    |
         +------------+------------+
         |     80     |     80     |
         |     70     |     70     |
         +------------+------------+

         You can Aggregate them into new feature new column
         +------------+------------+-------------+
         | Math       | Science    |  Avg        |
         +------------+------------+-------------+

Q6. Write note on Feature Discretization
    Discretization
       1. Feature Discretization is the process of converting continuous numerical data
          into discrete categories or bins.
       2. It help in reducing complexity
       3. It improve model performance.
       4. Make it easier to see patterns

       Example -
          For a continuous Age feature:   
          Age: 15, 25, 35, 50

          Discretization in categories
          Age: Young, Adult, Adult, Senior

Q7. Explain Feature Sampling in detail with its types
      Feature Sampling
       - Feature Sampling is the process of selecting a smaller set of features 
         from a larger dataset to make a model faster, simpler, and more accurate.
      Types 
         1. Random Sampling
            - Pick feature randomly.
         2. Subset Selection
            - Choose important feature
         3. Stratified Sampling
            - Choose balanced feature 
         4. RFE
            - Remove less important feature.
            - Stand for Recursive Feature Elimination

Q8. What is Feature Encoding and explain term Nominal and Ordinals ?
Q10. Explain One Hot Encoding with example

   Feature Encoding 
      1. Feature Encoding is the process of converting categorial 
         data into numbers so that machine learning models can understand and work with it.

   Nominal
    1. Nominal means no order between categories
    2. Example Color (Red, Yellow, Green)
    3. Encoding Eg
       Red = [1, 0, 0]

        Red | Blue | Green
        ----|------|------
         1  |  0   |  0
         0  |  1   |  0
         0  |  0   |  1
         
-------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ordinal 
    1. Has Order between categories
    2. Example Rating (Low, Medium, High)
    3. Encoding Eg 
       Low = 0, Medium = 1, High = 2

Q9. What is the interval and ratio in feature encoding
   1. Interval Data
      1. Number which have meaningful difference between them but not a True Zero.
      2. Example -
         Temperature in Celsius ( 0¬∞C doesn‚Äôt mean "no temperature")
      3. It usually used as-is relationship
      4. can be normalized
      5. can be standardized 

   2. Ratio
      1. Number which have meaningful difference between them and are True Zero
      2. Example:
         Height, weight, age, income (0 means absence of value)
      3. It also used as-is relationship
      4. can be normalized
      5. can be standardized 

###################################################################################################
Q11. Explain Standardization in brief with example 
    Standardization
      1. Standardization is the process of transforming numberical data so that it has Mean and Standard Division
      2. This helps machine learning model to work better
      3. It improve model performance.

      Standardized¬†Value=    (x‚àíŒº)/ œÉ

      Where:
         ùë•  = original value   
         Œº = mean     
         œÉ = standard deviation

      Example 
      original height value  = 5, 10, 15
      Mean = 10
      standart deviation = 2

      eg 5 = (5-10)/2 = -2.5
         10 = (10-10)/2 = 0
         15 = (15-10)/2 = 2.5
      
      Therefore Standarised Value = -2.5, 0, 2.5

Q12. Explain Normalization in detail with proper example
   Normalization 
      1. Normalization is the process of scaling data values to a common range, usually between 0 and 1,
         so that all features contribute equally to the model.
      2. It improve the performance
      3. It enhance the training speed.
      4. It is KNN, SVM, Neural Networks.
   
      5. Example 
         - You have these 3 numbers:
         - 20, 40, 60
         Normalize them between 0 and 1.
      
         step - 1 Find Min and Max
            Min = 20
            Max = 60
         step - 2 Apply Formula
          
              x = (x - min) / (max - min)
         
         step - 3. Normalize Each Value
            
            For 20,
                 = 20 - 20/ 60 - 20 
                 = 0
            
            For 40,
                = 40-20 / 60-20
                = 20 / 40
                = 1/2
                = 0.5

            For 60
                = 60 - 20 / 60-20
                = 40/40
                = 1
         
         Original        normalize values 
            20                 0
            40                 0.5
            60                 1

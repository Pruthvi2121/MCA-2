SVM
1. SVM stands for Support Vector Machine.
2. It is one of the most popular supervised learning Algorigthm which is used
   for both classification as well as Regression Problems.
3. However it is mainly used in Classficication Problems in Machine Learning.
4. SVM algorithm is used for 
   Face Detection,
   Image Clasisification,
   Text categorization etc/.


Here in the diagram there are two classes 
Class A and Class b
it is propelry classefied 
and the middle line between them is Dicision boundry line
this is created by SVM

5. Tyes of SVM
    1. Linear SVM
        Here two classes are sperated by single stright line (descicion boundry line) 

    2. Non Linear SVM
        here classes are not sperated by a stright line are non Linear SVM

Naive Bayes Classfier Algorightm
1. Naive Bayes Algorithm is supervised Machine Learning Alogorithm
2. Naive Byaes Algorithm is based on Bayes Theorem.
3. It is used for solving classification problems.
4. This algorithm mainly used in text classfication, object classfication
   where high dimentional training is include.
5. It is very easy and simple
6. It is simple to implement
7. It has very fast algorithm.
8  Some Examples for Navie Bayes Classfier Algorithm are
   - SPAM filterization
   - Text Classfication 
   - Object Classfication
   - Sentimental Analysis. etc
9. It is called Navive because - there are multipal feature in datasets
10. It is called bayes becuase - It depends on the principal of bayes Theorem

  Bias Therom =    
  
    P(A/B)  = P(B/A) P(A)/ P(B)
